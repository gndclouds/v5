<hr />

<p>News aggregation has been controlled by publishers of printed media up until the 21st century. Although they still publish the majority or news-related content, we have more companies and individuals the ever to follow. But the tools today are underdeveloped, some lock you into a specific publisher, others only support written media, and others probit smaller independent writers. Here I will outline some trends in the history of news services and suggest some possible futures.</p>

<h3 id="rss-narration"><strong>RSS Narration</strong></h3>

<p>A few popular news aggregators have added a text-to-speech functionality, and the two leaders would appear to be <a href="https://www.notion.so/tinyfactories/RSS-Readers-News-Apps-in-2020-bb8ae70fd78d42f28fabdacd1959bfbc">Pocket</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/tinyfactories/RSS-Readers-News-Apps-in-2020-bb8ae70fd78d42f28fabdacd1959bfbc">Instapaper</a>. Each is limited to a range of 0.5x to 4x playback, and you can not see the text when listening to the text. But both support creating a playlist of selected content to listen to, which would be similar to how we let listeners play an entire folder. But one thing they both do which we do not is they have an auditory marker to help you way-find as you listen to the content. For example, a Chapter or Article Title may be read in a different voice, or a chime will play at the end of an article to indicate it’s completed.</p>

<p>I think adding audio indicators at Then end of an article, chapter titles, end of reading a folder, when a book/article has finished being processed, reading highlighted content, when the text starts based on the work your tap. Adding these indicators would help with navigation and would increase the listening experience.</p>

<p><strong>Instapaper</strong></p>

<h3 id="multi-media-rss"><strong>Multi-Media RSS</strong></h3>

<p>Readers built into browsers like in Mozilla and Safari have an option to save web articles for later reading. Most of the current new aggregators separate media into different collections like “articles” and “media” but they are not connected in any way. For example you can not listen to a podcast from your rss feed and then a spoken article. But since we have the option to listen to folders of content maybe that could be a good feature to look into.</p>

<p><strong>Firefox -</strong> uses a native pocket integration to track the articles for offline and for multi-media rss management.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c0fc4d5d-2fd1-4e38-9ff7-2fd37a3ae25a/Untitled.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c0fc4d5d-2fd1-4e38-9ff7-2fd37a3ae25a/Untitled.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Safari</strong> - on the left hand side there is an option to save articles for later via your reading list.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f52d80b0-666b-4773-b663-2a6921611d66/Untitled.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f52d80b0-666b-4773-b663-2a6921611d66/Untitled.png" /></p>

<h3 id="social-rss"><strong>Social RSS</strong></h3>

<p>A few apps have started to allow customers to follow others within the app. Outside of social media apps, this usually is still just a feed of content occasionally with commenting. In Breaker, for example, you can see what others have listened to, recommended, or commented on. Then in Pocket you can see highlighted and favored content.</p>

<h1 id="what-could-speechify-look-into">What could Speechify look into?</h1>

<p>One of the biggest things we can do is reduce friction points of importing content. But if you look at our current methods of content import, its mostly going to a cloud storage platform, selecting a file, and importing it, which is very practical. Or adding content from the iOS share menu. These are both great ways, but they don’t allow us to redirect to our app from other news systems very well, and they are all manual ways of importing content. I want to encourage us to look more at thinking about how we fit into existing news aggregation systems.</p>

<p>For this, we should look at how services like Feedly, for example, have a <em>save to instapaper</em> option. I would suggest we look at making a <em>save to speechify</em> option. Each major platform seems to have a different way to save to an external service, and we should try to be one of those external services.</p>

<p><a href="https://gfycat.com/smoggybadastarte">https://gfycat.com/smoggybadastarte</a></p>

<p>👀 Sidenote: Some of the top news services currently are: <a href="https://feedly.com">feedly</a>, <a href="https://news.google.com/?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en">google news</a>, <a href="https://getpocket.com">pocket</a>, <a href="https://flipboard.com">flipboard</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-news/">apple news</a>, and <a href="https://usepanda.com">panda</a>.</p>

<p>The next phase, after better integrations, could be adding an RSS import option to our app. So new articles from feeds would be surfaced on the main home screen in a new section. Similar to Google News but more relevant to a given Listener. In the example here we could keep the same card style that we are using for the current Google News Card but just have the links pull from sources selected by the user.</p>

<p>But away we could take it even further would be to support RSS feeds right in the app. This would help provide a constant feed of content for our Listeners to listen to.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4388f5ed-cf26-4283-bc09-3d2bbf1ade36/C57F6895-A9DF-458A-8145-C213066AFD5C.jpeg" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4388f5ed-cf26-4283-bc09-3d2bbf1ade36/C57F6895-A9DF-458A-8145-C213066AFD5C.jpeg" /></p>

<p>Lastly, a yet to be adopted feature for news apps is social feeds. Yes, you can share articles, and some feed management services even let you share articles you have saved with people that follow you. But none let you automatically share articles once they have read, or share notes/highlights from an article.</p>

<p><a href="https://gfycat.com/desertedcriminalduckbillplatypus">https://gfycat.com/desertedcriminalduckbillplatypus</a></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>So there are two things I want to call out here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We should automate more content importing (maybe it is part of a premium feature set).</li>
  <li>We could just become a news aggregator too especially since the entry to space has a rather low bar.</li>
  <li>Adding a social layer is not making much progress in that space, but we could.</li>
</ol>

<p>One thought experiment I think could be interesting to do. Is What would it look like if we made HD Voices “free” and made up the cost by offering a different paid feature set?</p>
