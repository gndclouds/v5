[K2](https://www.kidnext.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/k2/index.html) is a collaboration between [Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/) and [Kaist University](http://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/) to create a lab for design-driven innovation in Asia. When I attended the focus was on _Designing Future Cities_ and what adaptations a city like Fukuoka might make in the areas of Home, Mobility, Community, Learning, Work, and Peace of Mind by the year 2030. During the workshop, we worked with students from design universities across the world alongside designers from within companies in Japan.


# A City as your Home

We wanted to focus on the notion of what _home_ might mean in Fukuoka in 2030. We explored the notion of what home mean to us, how a culture like Japan might embrace technology to create a city which feels like your home. Instead of limiting the notion of home to where one sleeps. We created a video to showcase what three sensations.



## 1 | Accommodating Accessibility

Cities can be complex environments to navigate, so we wanted to explore how a smart city might help you when you need it most. In this case, when you are crossing the street, we add some additional time to the crosswalk timer to help reduce stress, give space, and help make the city more accessible.

## 2 | Family Mindfulness

Cities across Japan already provide ways for families to feel safe on transportation, weather its reserved seating, or kids using metro cards to tell parents when they are at school by tapping in at the building entrance. To build on this, we looked at how a pregnant mother might need a seat on a city bus, and how we could prenotify passengers to open up a seat.

## 3 | Emotional Advocate

We all have down moments in life, and many cities don't provide adequate emotional health resources for their citizens. We explore how a city might help you with a small gesture when you're down.
