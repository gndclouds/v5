house is a project focused on the long-term dwelling of humans on earth. Phase one was a year-long research phase looking at how to decentralize all public utilities. In partnership with Utopia, Stone Edge Micro-grid, and Center for Art and Public Life at California College of the Arts, we are publishing what we learned as we determine the best next steps.

What do we mean by “decentralize all public utilities”? Well, today if you want water, power, waste, or communication to be available at you home you need to connect to your cities or counties' utility grid. We are researching a future in which you can be separated from that grid system. This may sound a bit like a micro-grid but thinking even smaller. Our focus is on what we are calling the pico grid or a grid that can service all traditional public utility needs of one household. To achieve this, we are working to develop a “core” which would maintain and manage all your utilities.

![Example Modal of Core](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/7661014/original_5c1f9b40f4bbedc9fa02267e075ba45b.png?1592106672?bc=0)

We think that cities will contine to grow [^1] and suburbs will become more dense until they become more like cities. So our core would look into optimitizng suburbs and more traditional apartment building. Now it might make sense to create a specific system to handel water, power, and communications all seporatly. But we are interested at the intersections in which we camn rejuce joing waste across all utilites.


# Pico-Grids
We think one soulutiuon could be to make a _plug-n-play_ style unit for new construciton buildings which combind all the utilites into one and help save waste enerfy.

This however may need to be simplified to fixfture connections if its to be used more tradational home architerxtures.


# What can we make today?

Making a core will take several years of research and development by its self. But we also wanted to explore how we could start with a product today and transition to a core like model over time. So to communicate what this might look like, we created three products around power, water, and internet to show how we might start augmenting current appliances today. Some starting products might be a Router, Sink, and Switch as shown below.



## Router

## Sink

Wastewater shouldn’t be discarded after one use! We created a way to filter and capture the waste materials from the sink to be used as a dry compost material. Either in your garden or given to a local farm. Then the gray water could be more easily upcycled locally in your home into water plants or flushing your toilet. It would essentially replace your current garbage disposal.

      It takes a lot of energy to clean the wastewater we use when we can be filtering and reusing a lot of it as gray water, which would double the lifespan of the water and cut the embedded energy almost in half.
