The iPhone 11 was announced today, and it is the first product I contemplated not because I feel I need the device but because it could be useful for a nomad.

For the last few months, I have been waiting to get a DSLR again, thinking the Sony A rIII, but it would be one more thing when traveling, whereas I would need a phone anyway. And for the past year, the moment lenses have been good for most of my needs. They recently had a campaign asking for people to guess which image was taken on moment vs. DSLR.


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of these is taken with an iPhone XS + Moment and the other with a $3,000 DSLR. Any guesses? <a href="https://t.co/KFdvZuwQss">pic.twitter.com/KFdvZuwQss</a></p>&mdash; Moment (@moment) <a href="https://twitter.com/moment/status/1166808450938155008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
Left: iPhone Right:DSLR

Growing up as a child of a photographer, it was more clear to me that the right was a DSLR more than the left being and iPhone. But my mind jumps at thinking about how exciting it is to think of the phone as such an accessible tool to most people, whereas a DSLR is typically far less common.

But it’s still sad that the craftsmanship element feels a little lost. Don’t get me wrong, you can craft an image with a phone just like every other tool, but the default is all auto.
What was your last camera?
