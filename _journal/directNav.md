In an early build of [are.na](http://are.na), you could click on the channel name to edit it's name. I implemented something inspired by that notion: When you click the page title in the navbar, you can enter any page path and go to that page.

The current implementation is very hidden and I think with a nice hover effect it could increase the discoverability. Currently, its mostly for me to quickly jump around my site.
