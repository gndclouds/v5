NOTES FROM

New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future

James Bridle

Chasm
Computational thinking is an extension of what others have called solutionism: the belief that any given problem can be solved by the application of computation.

Chasm
you should be able to understand technological systems without having to learn to code at all, just as one should not need to be a plumber to take a shit

Chasm
When one has a hammer, goes the saying, everything looks like a nail. But this is to not think the hammer. The hammer, properly conceived, has many uses. It may pull nails as well as drive them; it may forge iron, shape wood and stone, reveal fossils, and fix anchors for climbing ropes. It may pass sentence, call to order, or be thrown in a contest of athletic strength. Wielded by a god, it generates the weather. Thor’s hammer, Mjölnir, which created thunder and lightning when it was struck, also gave birth to hammer-shaped amulets intended to provide protection against the god’s wrath – or, through their resemblance to crosses, against enforced conversion. Prehistoric hammers and axes, turned up by the ploughs of later generations, were called ‘thunderstones’ and were believed to have fallen from the sky during storms. These mysterious tools thus became magical objects: when their original purposes passed away, they were capable of taking on new symbolic meaning. We must re-enchant our hammers – all our tools – so they are less like the carpenter’s, and more like Thor’s. More like thunderstones

Computation
In Weather Prediction by Numerical Process , published in 1922, Richardson reviewed and summarised his calculations, and laid out a little thought experiment for achieving them more efficiently with the technology of the day. In this experiment, the ‘computers’ were still human beings, and the abstractions of what we would come to understand as digital computation were laid out at the scale of architecture:

Computation
All stable processes we shall predict. All unstable processes we shall control.

September 19, 20192. Computation
Modern security procedures have removed the possibility of paper identification or processing: software is the only accepted arbiter of the process. Nothing can be done; nobody can move. As a result, a software crash revokes the building’s status as an airport, transforming it into a huge shed filled with angry people. This is how largely invisible computation coproduces our environment – its critical necessity revealed only in moments of failure, like a kind of brain injury.

Computation
Just as global telecommunications have collapsed time and space, computation conflates past and future. That which is gathered as data is modelled as the way things are, and then projected forward – with the implicit assumption that things will not radically change or diverge from previous experiences. In this way, computation does not merely govern our actions in the present, but constructs a future that best fits its parameters. That which is possible becomes that which is computable. That which is hard to quantify and difficult to model, that which has not been seen before or which does not map onto established patterns, that which is uncertain or ambiguous, is excluded from the field of possible futures. Computation projects a future that is like the past – which makes it, in turn, incapable of dealing with the reality of the present, which is never stable.

Climate
These are a recent invention, developed by NASA in response to the 1973 oil crisis and gradually retrofitted for commercial aircraft to increase fuel efficiency. They always bring to mind the epitaph of Buckminster Fuller, as written on his gravestone in Cambridge, Massachusetts: ‘Call me trimtab.’ Tiny in-flight adjustments, performed at scale. This is what we remain capable of. History – progress – does not always go up and to the right: it’s not all sunlit uplands. And this isn’t – cannot be – about nostalgia. Rather, it is about acknowledging a present that has come unhinged from linear temporality, that diverges in crucial yet confusing ways from the very idea of history itself. Nothing is clear anymore, nor can it be. What has changed is not the dimensionality of the future, but its predictability. In a 2016 editorial for the New York Times , computational meteorologist and past president of the American Meteorological Society William B. Gail cited a number of patterns that humanity has studied for centuries, but that are disrupted by climate change: long-term weather trends, fish spawning and migration, plant pollination, monsoon and tide cycles, the occurrence of ‘extreme’ weather events. For most of recorded history, these cycles[…]

Climate
The archipelago was to be demilitarised, and to this day it remains a uniquely visa-free zone: anyone may settle and work on the islands regardless of country of origin or citizenship, provided they have some means of support. Alongside nearly 2,000 Norwegians and almost 500 Russians and Ukranians, Svalbard is home to several hundred non-Nordic people, including Thai and Iranian workers. In recent years, a number of asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected in Norway have made their way to Svalbard to wait out the seven years residency required to gain Norwegian nationality.

Climate
Altogether, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates, 75 per cent of crop biodiversity has been lost. 6 Such diversity is essential to countering the risk of new diseases or pests that might emerge, threatening to wipe out homogenous varieties. The Svalbard collection is intended to provide secure storage for diverse strains in case of catastrophe: technically on long-term loan, its contents are not meant to be accessed unless all other sources have failed. In January 2012, the national seed bank of the Philippines was destroyed by fire, six years after it had been heavily damaged by flooding, while those of Afghanistan and Iraq have been completely destroyed by fighting. 7 In 2015, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) requested the first withdrawal from the vault: 130 of the 325 boxes it had deposited, containing a total of 116,000 samples.

Climate
Perhaps, he wonders, we have already passed through ‘peak knowledge’, just as we may have already passed peak oil. A new dark age looms.

Climate
We may perceive hyperobjects as personal because they affect us directly, or imagine them as the products of scientific theory; in fact, they stand outside both our perception and our measurement. They exist without us. Because they are so close and yet so hard to see, they defy our ability to describe them rationally, and to master or overcome them in any traditional sense

Climate
At 1,000 ppm, human cognitive ability drops by 21 per cent. 33 At higher atmospheric concentrations, CO 2 stops us from thinking clearly

Climate
indoors, in poorly ventilated homes, schools, and workplaces, it can regularly exceed 1,000 ppm

Climate
The structures we have built to extend our own life systems, our cognitive and haptic interfaces with the world, are the only tools we have for sensing a world dominated by the emergence of hyperobjects

Climate
Perhaps unique among hyperobjects, the network is an emergent cultural form, generated from our conscious and unconscious desires in dialogue with mathematics and electrons and silicon and glass fibre. That this network is currently being (mis)used to accelerate the crisis, as we will see in subsequent chapters, does not mean it does not retain the potential to illuminate.

There’s an idea in the science-fiction community called steam-engine time, which is what people call it when suddenly twenty or thirty different writers produce stories about the same idea. It’s called steam-engine time because nobody knows why the steam engine happened when it did. Ptolemy demonstrated the mechanics of the steam engine, and there was nothing technically stopping the Romans from building big steam engines. They had little toy steam engines, and they had enough metalworking skill to build big steam tractors. It just never occurred to them to do it. 1

psychogeography in 1955 as ‘the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organised or not, on the emotions and behaviour of individuals’.

September 23, 20195. Complexity
The haves paid for nanoseconds; the have-nots had no idea that a nanosecond had value. The haves enjoyed a perfect view of the market; the have-nots never saw the market at all . What had once been the world’s most public, most democratic, financial market had become, in spirit, something more like a private viewing of a stolen work of art. 15

Behind a few pixels on Amazon’s homepage are hidden the labour of thousands of exploited workers: every time the buy button is pressed, electronic signals direct a real human to set off in motion, to perform their efficient duty. The app is a remote control device for other people, but one whose real-world effects are almost impossible to see.

Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics, formulated in the 1940s, state, 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws. 35

1921 essay The Task of the Translator : that the most faithful translation ignores its original context to allow a deeper meaning to shine through. Benjamin insisted on the primacy of the word over the sentence, of the manner of meaning over its matter: ‘A real translation is transparent,’ he wrote. ‘It does not cover the original, does not block its light, but

September 26, 2019No title
allows the pure language, as though reinforced by its own medium, to shine upon the original all the more fully.’

September 26, 2019No title
This is called ‘zero-shot’ translation, and what it implies is the existence of an ‘interlingual’ representation: an internal metalanguage composed of shared concepts across languages. This is, to all intents, Benjamin’s pure language

To these we might add a fourth: a robot – or any other intelligent machine – must be able to explain itself to humans. Such a law must intervene before the others, because it takes the form not of an injunction to the other, but of an ethic

It is a nightmarish scene, yet one that seems to embody the conditions of a new dark age. Our vision is increasingly universal, but our agency is ever more reduced. We know more and more about the world, while being less and less able to do anything about it. The resulting sense of helplessness, rather than giving us pause to reconsider our assumptions, seems to be driving us deeper into paranoia and social disintegration: more surveillance, more distrust, an ever-greater insistence on the power of images and computation to rectify a situation that is produced by our unquestioning belief in their authority.

the airspace over the continental United States was clear of civilian and commercial aircraft. Apart from military aircraft and prisoner transports, nothing flew over North America for three days. During those three days between September 11 and 14, the difference between day and night temperatures, known as the average diurnal temperature range (DTR), showed a marked increase. Across the whole continent, the DTR increased by more than one degree Celsius, while for regions in the Midwest, Northeast and Northwest, where contrail coverage was usually the greatest, it more than doubled the seasonal average. 28 An act of violence, like so many before it, was recorded in the weather itself.

Within such systems, even rational responses lead to irrational outcomes. The individual is aware of the irrationality but loses all power to act in their own interest. Faced with the roiling tide of information, we attempt to gain some kind of control over the world by telling stories about it: we attempt to master it through narratives. These narratives are inherently simplifications, because no one story can account for everything that’s happening; the world is too complex for simple stories. Instead of accepting this, the stories become ever more baroque and bifurcated, ever more convoluted and open-ended

Then when I’m on the internet, and I see something where I’m like, “Holy shit, really ?” I’m led down this path of believing it. I don’t have the knowledge that a journalist has about how verifiable is the source. When you’re just a standard person, you can really be led to believe anything. Because of the internet, anybody can put news out there. How do I know if it’s the truth or not? It makes it hard when you’re trying to choose a president. People chose Donald Trump because [they thought] he tweeted he was gonna stop chemtrails – you know what I mean

At its current rate of expansion, the aviation industry alone will by 2050 account for the entirety of the carbon dioxide emissions permitted to hold global warming below the two-degree-Celsius crisis point

the anthropocene starts with mass genocide, with planetary violence on such a scale that it registers in ice cores and the pollination of crops.

if we should choose to do so, allows us to sample from the myriad of explanations that our limited cognition stretches like a mask over the vibrating half-truths of the world. It is a better approximation of reality than any rigid binary encoding can ever hope to be – an acknowledgement that all our apprehensions are approximations, and all the more powerful for being so.

October 6, 2019No title
No controls are possible without collapsing the entire system. Exploitation is encoded into the systems we are building, making it harder to see, harder to think and explain, harder to counter and defend against. What makes it disturbing is that this is not a science fictional exploitative future of AI overlords and fully robot workforces in the factories, but exploitation in the playroom, in the living room, in the home and the pocket, being driven by exactly the same computational mechanisms. And humans are degraded on both sides of the equation: both those who, numbed and terrified, watch the videos; and those who, low paid or unpaid, exploited or abused, make them. In between sit mostly automated corporations, taking the profit from both sides.

Here is another take on the automation of dystopia: a social site where it’s impossible to be social, half the participants are shadows, and participation is only possible through payment.Those exposed to the system had no way of knowing what was occurring, apart from the suspicion that something might be wrong. And it was impossible to act on that suspicion without destroying the fantasy on which the entire enterprise was assembled. The collapse of the infrastructure – the hack – revealed its bankruptcy, but it had already been made explicit in the technological framing of an abusive system.

Schmidt’s – and Google’s – worldview is one that is entirely predicated on the belief that making something visible makes it better, and that technology is the tool to make things visible. This view, which has come to dominate the world, is not only fundamentally wrong; it is actively dangerous, both globally and in the specific instance that Schmidt states

October 6, 2019No title
Such a denunciation of the degraded power of the image should not, however, be taken as support of Schmidt’s position that more images or more information, however democratically and distributedly generated, would have helped

October 6, 2019No title
Oil is, despite everything, defined by its exhaustibility. We are already approaching peak oil, and while every oil shock prompts us to engage and exploit some new territory or some destructive technology – further endangering the planet and ourselves – the wells will eventually run dry. The same is not true of information, despite the desperate fracking that appears to be occurring when intelligence agencies record every email, every mouse click, and the movements of every cell phone. While peak knowledge may be closer than we think, the exploitation of raw information can continue infinitely, along with the damage it does to us and our ability to reckon with the world.

October 6, 2019No title
The mutually assured privacy meltdown of state surveillance and leak-driven countersurveillance activism is one example of this failure, as is the confusion caused by real-time information overload from surveillance itself. So is the discovery crisis in the pharmacological industry, where billions of dollars in computation are returning exponentially fewer drug breakthroughs

October 6, 2019No title
But what we should be seeing is the network itself, in all of its complexity. The network is only the latest, but certainly the most advanced, civilisation-scale tool for introspection our species has built thus far. To deal with the network is to deal with a Borgesian infinite library and all the inherent contradictions contained within it: a library that will not converge and continually refuses to cohere. Our categories, summaries and authorities are no longer merely insufficient; they are literally incoherent. As H. P. Lovecraft noted in his annunciation of a new dark age, our current ways of thinking about the world can no more survive exposure to this totality of raw information than we can survive exposure to an atomic core.

October 6, 2019No title
Our current life support systems on a planet of 7.5 billion and rising utterly depend upon them. Our understanding of those systems and their ramifications, and of the conscious choices we make in their design, in the here and now, remain entirely within our capabilities. We are not powerless, not without agency, and not limited by darkness. We only have to think, and think again, and keep thinking. The network – us and our machines and the things we think and discover together – demands it.
