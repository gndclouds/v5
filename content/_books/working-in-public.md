INTRODUCTION
>“For this to be possible, the method of storage must not place its own restraints on the information,”

INTRODUCTION
>Some developers deftly handle demand from their users without any financial compensation. And even paid open source developers seem to go through the same strange behavioral cycle, in a way that seems less common among those who write “proprietary,” or private, code for their employers.

INTRODUCTION
>Maintainers frequently lack infrastructure to bring these contributors into a “contributor community”; in many cases, there is no community behind the project at all, only individual efforts.


INTRODUCTION
>Open source code is public, but it doesn’t have to be participatory: maintainers can buckle under excess demand for their attention.

INTRODUCTION
>nearly half of all contri­butors only contributed once. These contributors accounted for less than 2% of total commits, or overall contributions.
I wonder if it’s the same percentage transcript online communities, Especially given how much of the time I see a group with 5 to 30,000 participants and there’s never more than 300 to 3000 online.

INTRODUCTION
>The role of a maintainer is evolving. Rather than coordinating with a group of developers, these maintainers are defined by the need for cur­ation: sifting through the noise of interactions, such as user questions, bug reports, and feature requests, which compete for their attention.

INTRODUCTION
>problem facing maintainers today is not how to get more contributors but how to manage a high volume of frequent, low-touch interactions

01: GITHUB AS A PLATFORM
>Richard Stallman

01: GITHUB AS A PLATFORM
>today’s developers hardly even notice “open source” as a concept anymore. They just want to write and publish their code, and GitHub is the platform that makes it easy to do that.
I’m curious to see how this changes with Ken Qi, from what we see currently in social media practices the openness to share something that feels authentic seems incredibly valuable which makes me wonder if he will only perpetuate the problem of maintainers meaning to manage too many contributors for get a project.

01: GITHUB AS A PLATFORM
>They just publish their code on GitHub because, as with any other form of online content today, sharing is the default

01: GITHUB AS A PLATFORM
>Bill Gates, who defines a platform as “when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it.”

01: GITHUB AS A PLATFORM
>Mikeal Rogers calls the “amateurization of open source,” where “pushing code became almost as routine as tweeting”

02: THE STRUCTURE OF AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
>The relationship between a project’s maintainers and their comm­unity changes depending on the maturity of the project. At a high level, open source projects tend to move from closed —> open —> either closed or distributed development (depending on their size).

02: THE STRUCTURE OF AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
>Open source is complicated because it contains a messy mix of both technical and social norms, most of which play out in public. It is documented extensively (nearly every decision is written down somewhere) but not clearly (you have to dig through years of mailing list archives to find what you need). Its treasures are hidden amidst a tangle of brambles and thorns.

02: THE STRUCTURE OF AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
>how code is distributed and consumed. It says nothing about how code is produced
We should write about this next phase of community development at tiny factories. Because no matter how much am I believe source there isn’t a model that dictates how that community should exist co-op feels close still a distinction between the public and private elements of the co-op


02: THE STRUCTURE OF AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
>Technical scope refers to the size and complexity of a project’s codebase: in other words, how much more there is to do. A project that feels feature-complete won’t attract as many contributors as one that’s extensible and customizable. It could be widely used, but that doesn’t mean there’s a lot to contribute to.

02: THE STRUCTURE OF AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
>Support required refers not just to writing code for the project but also to supporting tasks, like responding to open issues or reviewing others’ pull requests. The former is considered to be “fun” work that potential contributors clamor to take on, but the latter is necessary work that tends to fall exclusively on maintainers. It’s much easier to entice a new contributor to write an interesting new feature than it is to ask them to triage issues.

02: THE STRUCTURE OF AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
>Ease of participation refers to how easy it is for someone to contribute to the project. Whether a project is easy to contribute to is partly a function of its technical scope, but there are other factors involved: the quality of its documentation, how responsive the maintainers are, the perceived hostility (or lack thereof) in social interactions, and the tools or preexisting skills required to make a contribution. Most important is the question of whether the project is on GitHub or not.

02: THE STRUCTURE OF AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
>User adoption refers to a project’s reach: What is the total addressable market of contributors? How many people could potentially contribute to this project? Since most contributors start out as users of an open source project, user adoption is one heuristic for estimating a project’s total potential contributor base.

03: ROLES, INCENTIVES, AND RELATIONSHIPS
>Through her research, Ostrom identified eight design principles that contribute to a well-managed, successful commons: Membership boundaries are clearly defined. The rules that govern the commons should match the actual conditions. Those who are affected by these rules can participate in modifying them. Those who monitor the rules are either community members or are accountable to the community, rather than outsiders. Those who violate the rules are subject to graduated sanctions, which vary depending on the seriousness and context of the offense. Conflicts should be resolved within the community, using low-cost methods. External authorities recognize the right of community members to devise their own institutions. If the commons is part of a larger system, its governing rules are organized into multiple “nested” layers of authority.110 Thematically, these conditions point to the need for a strong sense of group identity, which makes governance processes like rules, dispute resolution, and sanctions (i.e., corrective actions) more meaningful.

03: ROLES, INCENTIVES, AND RELATIONSHIPS
By removing “property and contract,” the commons will theoretically select for the best person for the job at a lower cost.

04: THE WORK REQUIRED BY SOFTWARE
>some commentators have called “the cornucopia of the commons,” in which more value is created as more people use the resource and join the social community. The operative principle is “the more, the merrier.” The value of a telephone network, a scientific literature or an open source software program actually increases as more people come to participate.203 Rivalry and excludability properties of economic goods. These two properties, taken together, mean that we tend to treat open source code as a public good. In the strictest sense of the word, however, software is not quite non-rivalrous. As when more cars merge onto a highway during rush hour, the marginal cost incurred between the first and second software user may be negligible or even undetectable. But eventually

04: THE WORK REQUIRED BY SOFTWARE
>Code that runs in production, like C, is in active state. It’s a living organ­ism, like a tree in a forest. It depends on other things, and other things depend on it to survive.

04: THE WORK REQUIRED BY SOFTWARE
>Technology policy writer David Bollier paints a rosy picture of what he calls the “information commons,” or online information goods, including open source software, under the commonly held belief that these are non-rival goods. According to Bollier, not only is software nondepletable but it can only benefit from attracting more people

04: THE WORK REQUIRED BY SOFTWARE
>The security vulnerability had been disclosed with a CVE ID several months before, and a patch had been released, but Equifax’s developers failed to update the company’s software in time.227
August 18, 2020 05: MANAGING THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
We can’t ever completely abstract away the cost of maintenance, because software still degrades over time, regardless of how many people use it. Developers can only reduce those costs enough that it feels sustainable, find new ways to dedicate time to maintenance, or hand off the project to a new maintainer. At a high level, it’s also possible that throwing away projects and starting fresh is the most cost-effective approach: rebuilding the whole system, piece by piece. Maybe it’s not the maintenance of any one project that we’re trying to solve for, but the broader ecosystem

05: MANAGING THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
>Homebrew’s lead maintainer, Mike McQuaid, limits his available attention by using a tiered approach to managing contributions: FIRST-TIME CONTRIBUTORS need documentation, templates, and automated checks “to encourage high quality pull requests,” as well as positive reinforcement when they do get a pull request merged, which encourages them to contribute again.292 SECOND-TIME CONTRIBUTORS warrant a mild increase in a maintainer’s attention, such as providing more detailed code review. Mike encourages maintainers to “make more ambitious requests” of the contributor, rather than trying to fix the contributor’s problems themselves. THIRD-TIME CONTRIBUTORS “now warrant . . . individual, focused attention,” including providing mentorship, suggesting additional areas of contribution, and vouching for their work to other community members.
What would this for like for a public facing version of time factories?


05: MANAGING THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
>When sharing is public, it’s possible to end up with too many leechers and not enough seeds, given that users have no incentive to upload their own content—only to consume it. In a private community, however, users are required to maintain a certain upload/download ratio; otherwise they’ll get kicked out.

05: MANAGING THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
>Peer-to-peer file sharing requires seeds. It doesn’t function as a one-way mirror, because consumers always impose a marginal cost onto producers. But users can consume open source code without affecting producers, so long as they don’t appropriate their attention.

05: MANAGING THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
socially acceptable, for existing developers to step down and move on

05: MANAGING THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
>They could charge money to open an issue or pull request, similar to how highways charge a higher toll during commute hours to reduce the number of cars on the road

05: MANAGING THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
>One popular project hosts regular “office hours” with its highest-paying supporters as a perk of sponsor­ship

05: MANAGING THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION
>Williams doesn’t build her reputation on GitHub, but on every other platform around it.

CONCLUSION
>Our social platforms were built for distributed, small-scale, many-to-many use cases: the quaint social world of yesteryear. They were modeled after internet forums, chat groups, and mailing lists, because these were the only blueprints that we had for our online social infrastructure. As more people flocked to these platforms, we saw a few bridges collapse, because, it turns out, we had no idea how to build bridges for today’s world.
August 18, 2020 CONCLUSION
A tragedy of the commons occurs not from consumers over-appropriating the content itself, but from consumers over-appropriating a creator’s attention.*

CONCLUSION
>Yancey Strickler, who cofounded Kickstarter, calls this the “dark forest theory” of the internet: “an increasing number of the population has scurried into their dark forests” to avoid the mainstream web, which has become “a relentless competition for power.”347

CONCLUSION
creators, enabling dedicated supporters to pitch in, instead of treating the creator as a single unit. They’re a tree in a forest, not a potted plant.

CONCLUSION
>Likes and emojis fit Benkler’s condition of granularity, which makes it possible for distributed social interactions to scale. Apple has added tapbacks to iMessage, and Facebook Messenger has added reactions to group chats, both of which make it easier to acknowledge and respond to messages.

CONCLUSION
>we have no notion of “organization building” to support high-demand creators as their audiences grow.

CONCLUSION
>Similarly, platforms must provide the support systems that creators need to be able to thrive.

CONCLUSION
>In a two-sided market, paying subscribers subsidize all of the content for nonpaying readers, under the assumption that creators aren’t actually selling content but a sense of membership and identity. Instead of charging, say, all 100,000 readers ten cents to read an article, creators can instead give away the article for free, but charge 1,000 extra-dedicated subscribers ten dollars per year

CONCLUSION
>PBS as a service

CONCLUSION
>And newsletters are another, curiously reemerging format, where creators can broadcast in longform to large audiences, without expectation of a dialogue. In
What dialog is tiny factories trying to have?
