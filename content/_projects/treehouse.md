Treehouse is an exploration of a dynamic, personalized dashboard for myself. The next step is coding out the interface and starting to expand my understanding of various API frameworks.

I started finishing up some designs for the treehouse/personal-dashboard project and got a little stuck. So I paused the visual design to map out the information architecture of the system I might want to include in each card. A big part of this project is creating a way for me to become more fluid at integrating various APIs to a project.



Currently, I'm planning on building the site in GatsbyJs and have been looking at integrating the following services:
- [X] Are.na
- [ ] Time Library
- [ ] Location Library
- [ ] Unsplash
- [ ] Glitch
- [ ] Userbase
- [ ] Firebase
- [ ] Giphy
- [ ] MySQL database.
