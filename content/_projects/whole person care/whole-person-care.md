We worked with the City of San Francisco's Department of Public Health to map the [Medi-Cal]() enrollment process for the homeless in San Francisco County. The goal was to create a new job position across multiple government branches that would help with communication and onboarding to the Medi-Cal system.

The deliverables were focused on the onboarding of multiple government branches so that they would understand how they help and block the enrollment process. We created a Field Guide to support a series of service blueprints for the primary three of the seven agencies who can start the enrollment process for the homeless. Indeed the most valuable thing we provided was the overview and space for conversations space for the various branches to talk face to face.

## Service Maps
As part of our research, we conducted 42 interviews with various medical service groups that handled Medi-Cal enrollment. Then after identifying the three main entry points, we created service blueprints to understand were "falling off" the Medi-Cal system occurred.
