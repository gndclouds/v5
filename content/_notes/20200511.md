It's been nice living abroad for a bit because it has reminded me of what I value about California and what I want to take advantage of while being in Taiwan. Every place you could live has ups and downs, no place is inherently good or bad, it's just you being in or out of balance. I'm starting to find more balance in Taiwan, as I transition from vacationing to living here. One thing I would like to do more of finds opportunities to eat durian while its in season.
