This has been the longest I have been outside of my home country. I have always and suspect I will continue to love experiencing different cultures as I travel. But for the first time, not knowing when I will be back is starting to get a little homesick. It's surprising what little moments are missed. Smelling fresh sourdough, the sandy salty wind on the beach, endless opportunities for teas and chai, in-person serendipitous citing of friends and family, and knowing the ins and outs of each street. I think for my next chapter I want to make the world feel like home.
