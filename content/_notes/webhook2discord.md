We have been working on building in more opportunities for feedback with in-out tools at [Tiny Factories](https://tinyfactories.space) while waiting as long as we can to start paying for new services. Webhooks & embedded forms have become our quick default for non-sensitive data. After the form is submitted, it [posts to a Discord channel](https://www.notion.so/tinyfactories/Add-System-Reporting-to-Discord-58d33e7da5704e23943dc6485183be01), which we use for tracking the project.
