Each day I have a glimpse of something that I can do now, but would have hesitated on a few weeks ago. The most consistent moment is around code. Not just remembering syntax or an element type but the logic of how to structure what I want to make. But then a few seconds later you get hit with a wall of indecipherable errors and a feeling of defeat. There is always something to learn, most of it comes in time. But we do need to improve human-machine collaboration so that a wall of errors is not how we debug. As it stifles the spirits of humans and machines.
