Something that surfaced again and again during my thesis [learning to learn](gndclouds.cc/learning-to-learn) was the notion of knowledge access. For me, this typically manifested in needing digial copies of text books, so that I could have my computer read them to me. So I started a list of [DRM Free Book Publishers](https://notion.so/tinyfactories/a9c391b2f0d94cc7b6a03cd9a7a4083f?v=65d645341e5f408eb9939003e6e98b7a) [^1] who allow for importing into apps like [Speechify](https://www.getspeechify.com/) and [Apple Books](https://www.apple.com/apple-books/) for better text-to-speech support ðŸ—£.


[^1]: This list is kept up today with new vendors, if you know of a publisher who is not on this list please reachout and I will add it.
