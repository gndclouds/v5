Ok, Iâ€™m finally back in the flow of thinking, learning, and making. I think the last few weeks have felt slow. It makes me realize how we need to continue to balance work in and out of tiny factories and set clear check-ins to make sure everything goes smoothly.

This past month I learned a lot about what forcing a collaboration means. I think I need to remain open to incorporating new things into Tiny Factories and personal projects while not straying too far from my motivations and personal goals. For me, this feels like it should manifest on following my gut and acting on it.

I think there are some new principles and questions that I need to think about more and then summarize in a follow-up post.
