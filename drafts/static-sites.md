humm, I think we could make that.
It reminds me a little of https://www.smallvictori.es/
Small Victories
and https://itty.bitty.site/ always felt cleaver too

Turns a folder into a blog automatically. Use your favorite text-editor to write. Text and Markdown files, Word Documents, images, bookmarks and HTML in your folder become blog posts.
Oh and Aetherpoint share https://obsidian.md/ which looked interesing too
but non of these really are as quick or simple as what you are recommending.
