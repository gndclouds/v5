Interesting learning about Server Side Rendering: When you are trying to reference local JS elements like document.getElementByID the server can't use document because the site is rendered without a browser :neutral_face: so if you are using react you need to specify not to render that element server-side. But you can keep other elements sever-side which is cool. You can implement this on Next.js like this: 


```
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const ComponentName = dynamic(
  () => import('../components/ComponentName'),
  { ssr: false }
)
Reference link for Next.js https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import#with-no-ssr
```

Going to add a dark mode too! :new_moon:

The css is super simple but I do with I could just tell my computer to invert the color :frowning: 
/* LIGHT MODE */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  body{
    background-color:white;
  }
}


/* DARK MODE */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body{
    background-color:black;
  }
}
