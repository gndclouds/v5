showed me that in Kinopio you can now add titles to images. And when you select images they have this super cool duotone effect that gets applied to them.

I have been playing around with Namebase.io as a way to possible earn some passive income by selling/licensing domains. And started a list of the domains  that Tiny Factories owns for current projects and future licensing, check them out here. https://www.notion.so/tinyfactories/51ad2fa2f0bd439486f08c3823ae2431?v=d60c48f287eb462ebe76e7b15eb7227c
