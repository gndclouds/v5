◻︎ Have been working on getting Figma to verify License Keys with Gumroad for the last few days and finally understand how to send a headless API request from a client :slight_smile: 
◻︎Create documentation around Figma to Gumroad license key verification.
◻︎Work on moving Moshi Moshi Chat to Heroku

Currently I can send a POST request to Gumroad's API with out new :sparkles: tiny-cors server.  Next I'm thinking of getting Figma to POST to the tiny-cors server. But am unsure if I should send the .json from Gumroad back to Figma or just have tiny-cors send a sucess or fail state to Figma? (Don't know what best practice would be)

First pass at our gumKeyVerification Function
```
function gumKeyVerification(customer_gum_key) {
var requestOptions = {
  method: 'POST',
  redirect: 'follow'
};

//Example URL
// https://api.gumroad.com/v2/licenses/verify?product_permalink=FxRJr&license_key=1223DB78-F8F04E96-9E9F1B83-3E9AE59B

var cors_server_url = ''// URL of the Tiny Cors Server on glitch
var gumroad_api_url = 'https://api.gumroad.com/v2/licenses/verify' //Gumroad's API URL
var product_id = 'FxRJr' // Product ID found in the Gumroad product page url

var api_request_url = 'https://' + cors_server_url + '/' + 'product_permalink=' + product_id + '&license_key=' + customer_gum_key; // Put all the information into a URL

fetch("api_request_url", requestOptions)
console.log(api_request_url)
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
})();
```
