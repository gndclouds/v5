→ Started making a clock that uses Japanese charters to tell time.

→ Moved wiki.gndclouds.cc to [glitch](https://glitch.com/~gndclouds-wiki) in hope of working it in smaller chunks.

→ Did house keeping on some old notion docs

→ Drafted some new thoughts on [readying supply](https://reading.supply/@gndclouds).

→ Started a new project with [Weiwei](https://twitter.com/glitchyowl) and [Jessmei美](https://twitter.com/jchangsta) based on making tweets into images
