I recently took a trip to Portland and stayed with a friend who is looking to install [geothermal heating and cooling]() into his home in 2020. They will need to drill down below his basement to install a long coil to act as a radiator between the house and the earth. This reminded me of how in the home I grew up in the basement was always a nice temperature compared to the rest of the house which was either to hot or to cold. So I wanted to explore a few housing ideas for homes in which the basement would help regulate the temperature of the home.
