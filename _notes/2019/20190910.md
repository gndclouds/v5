iPhone 11 was announced today and it was the first product I contemplated not because feel I need the device but because it could be good for a nomad.

For the last few months I have been waiting to get pick up a DSLR again, thinking the Sony A rIII, but it would be one more thing when traveling. Where as I would need a phone anyway. And for the past year the moment lenses have been great. They recently had a campaign asking for people to guess which image was taken on moment vs dslr.

Left: iPhone Right:DSLR

Growing up as a child of a photographer it was more clear to me that the right was a DSLR more then the left being and iPhone. But my mid did jump at thinking about what it means from a tool aces abilities perspective.

But it’s still sad that the craftsmanship element feels a little lost. Don’t get me wrong, you can craft and image with a phone just like every other tool but the default is all auto.

What was your last camera?
