First paying stranger, it happened. [tinyText](http://tinyText.today) launched last week and I was bummed. Little to know traction and site traffic was low, and no one signed up on launch day. Zero. And just two weeks earlier we launched [frienda]([https://www.frienda.space](https://www.frienda.space/)Â ) by mistake and it exceeded all expectations.

The bummer wasnâ€™t that is wasnâ€™t popular it was more about how I felt like I miss judged my goals for tintTexy. I wanted to

- Try making a subscriptions service
- Explore sending data via twilio
- Try to monetize a daily task of mine
- And get one paying stranger (ideally 10â€™strangers so I break evenÂ ðŸ˜¬)

But today it happened, one person paid us! So project goals have been met. One of the next conversation we need to have at [tiny factories]() is when we choose sunset a project.

Currently I'm thinking we should think of the following:

- [ ]  Have we made money over the last three months?
- [ ]  Have we gained any social traction or does sight traffic remain high?
