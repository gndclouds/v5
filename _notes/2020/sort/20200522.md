Spent most of the day learning about how to make a site with the GatsbyJS framework which uses stripe for reoccurring payments and OAuth for Authentication. It’s been a good rabbit hole and wanted to share some videos that helped me understand how to architect what we need for the tiny tools site.
First learning was how Gatsby works differently then other react frameworks because of how the build environment and Live site render differently https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdsKB6_6pdk

Secondly how Stripe uses their newish checkouts api to that you can add reoccurring  payments to any static site https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4aCBNt5Pcg

I think each video got me 30% closer to what I'm trying to do but no one has clean all in one example. But Nick DeJeasus has some wonderful examples of how to add strip to GatsbyJs which I highly recommend people check out https://github.com/dayhaysoos/gatsby-theme-stripe

I was also stuck on the architecture for authentication so I made a mini map so then when I asked twitter and discord for help it could slowly be refined with new learnings https://kinopio.club/gatsby-stripe-oauth-JH2nBMArrLGMUPr6Jt4_Z
