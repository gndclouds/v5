◻︎︎ Sort Gatsby post by categories 
◻︎︎ Read through Article Backlog
◻︎︎ Get some electronics 
◻︎︎ Generate pages for each tag on  a Gatsby site

After three days of breaking various parts of GatsbyJS I finally determined how to query posts by a category or tag. While generating all my post from markdown files :slight_smile:.

Will work on a cleaner graphic tomorrow but my 101 on GraphiQL has taught me this thus far.

For example in my notes.js file, I look for any fill with the category "note" and display it.
//notes.js
```
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import PostLink from "../components/post-link"

const IndexPage = ({
  data: {
    allMarkdownRemark: { edges },
  },
}) => {
  const Posts = edges
    .filter(edge => !!edge.node.frontmatter.date) // You can filter your posts based on some criteria
    .map(edge => <PostLink key={edge.node.id} post={edge.node} />)

  return <div>{Posts}</div>
}

export default IndexPage
export const pageQuery = graphql`
{
  allMarkdownRemark(sort: {order: DESC, fields: [frontmatter___date]}, filter: {frontmatter: {categories: {glob: "note"}}}) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        excerpt(pruneLength: 250)
        frontmatter {
          date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
          path
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

From what I can tell there is amore elegant way to do this with nested react component and using node to generate these pages and their children. But I'm having some trouble with the logic conflicts. So I'm hoping to use the next few days to style and finish move content form my old site. Then I can do an audit of the code and get Category pages (category/notes) and tag pages (tags/design) to be autogenerated on load.
If anyone knows react and would like to audit my code in a few days LMK :man_bowing_tone1: it would be greatly appreciated.
