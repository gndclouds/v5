Learned a bit more about Figma Plugins today!

You can post from your plugin to Figma with:
```
parent.postMessage(
                { pluginMessage: { type: "store-gumkey", verified_key } },
                "*");

```
And send data from Figma to your plugin with:

```
figma.ui.postMessage({
      type: "no-key",
      message: `not_verified`
    });
```
