Today I listened to a podcast by [Rich Roll](  ) and [ ](  ) on the impact of GMO foods in human health. There are manny alarming food production practices what where surfaced. One that I wanted to think about more is what nutritional value is lost from hydroponic farms. 

In the show they reference the notion of a [victory garden](  ) which became popular during the war as a method for the general public to contribute to the ware effect by growing food. And if feels like we will need something similar in the future but with increased density for urban environments. 

So can we get the same nutritional value from the hydroponic foods as non-gmo organic foods?
